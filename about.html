                <p>
                    I am a full stack web developer. I am curious and love to learn. I have jumped head first into coding once I got my first taste for it. I was always interested in coding and web development and never looked into. It wasn't until I was working and felt like I had reached my peek with were I was working.
                    It was at this time that I starting thinking about what I wanted to do with my life and how I could support my family.
